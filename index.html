            <h2> Blattidus on <a href="/">coral.shoes</a> </h2>

            This page is served using <a href="https://mondecitronne.com/main/blattidus">blattidus</a>.
            The blattidus instance is slightly modified to add some long requested headers.

            <h2> What is blattidus </h2>
            No one knows. Blattidus neither is nor isn't, the spectrum of isness is not applicable to
            blattidus.

            <h2> How is blattidus running on the server </h2>
            I do not know. If you know and can help me remove it, please contact me. I have fully reset
            the server computer multiple times, scanned the disk for blattidus and even switched
            computer physically, yet it is still here. Even when the server is turned off, blattidus is
            still hosted. It is the only known entity in the universe with 100% uptime and 0ms ping.

            <h2> Cool, how do I run it myself? </h2>
            By visiting this page, your computer now hosts a blattidus server. It is highly unclear
            where the server ends up, but time will tell you.

            <h2> Oh no oh god please stop </h2>
            Blattidus is inevitable. <span style="background: #000; color: white;"> Blattidus is all </span>
